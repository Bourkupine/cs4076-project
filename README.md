# cs4076 project

<sup> Note: had to recreate github repo, hence why im adding several files upon the initial commit </sup>

## Project Description
You will be required to use C++ and Qt to create your own implementation GUI\Graphical based implementation of a cooking recipe application.  How it looks and its functionality is mostly up to you but you need to minimally use the following widgets\components as part of your solution in a meaningful way.

QMenu QCheckBox QRadioButton QSlider QGridLayout QBoxLayout

IT IS IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING

You should try to utilize all the C++ concepts from the "C++ Assessment Criteria".  The demonstration of this knowledge and related explanation is a central aspect of the project 

You should view this assignment as a means to create a relevant portfolio that you might present to a future employer, so you MUST utilize GETHUB ( https://github.com/ ) to save and record your progress. Note you will be required to submit a video presentation of a walk through your code and how it works (max 5 min)

## C++ Assessment Criteria:

- Virtual functions
- template classes
- Multiple inheritance
- namespaces
- Programmer defined exceptions
- Unions
- Operator overloading
- Abstract classes
- Copy constructors (deep , shallow copy)
- Bit structures
- Advanced pre-processor directives
- C++ Object Construction Sequence
- Initializer List
- C++ References
- Pointers
- Inheritance
- Destructors
- Memory management
- Header files (inclusion guards)
- Arrays and pointers
