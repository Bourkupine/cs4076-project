Problems:
	cant add more than one ingredient to a recipe

Recipe:

View Recipe:
	have a button beside search that opens the advanced search options -> allergies, 
	difficulty
	sort by favourites
	have a horizontal slider with time
	add allergy search
	bit wise operations :"amount made" -> left shift to double amount

Add Recipe:
	Fix radio button colour
	Add favourite button
	Add amount made
	Make time to make formatted for time
	When adding ingredient, there needs to be a tickbox AND a spin box for amount:
		[] Ingredient Name [100]g
		Use inheritance to figure out if its grams or ml
		make it only show amount when you select it
	When adding ingredients users should only be able to select one ingredient at a time


View Ingredient:
	search functionality

Add Ingredient:
	reset allergies check boxes
	reset calorie amount
	instead of adding it based off when an ingredient is selected, after clicking button, check the state of the ingedients

Bit Map:
	0 or 1 value for something.
	00100110, each bit represents something (maps to it)
	00 for vegan and vegetarian
	use bitset	
		vegetarian = 1 << 0
		vegan = 1 << 1;

Union:
	store the amount using union (double d, int i) 
	01101100 -> 0110//1100

Inheritance:
	Write to CSV
